 The Library Management System organizes books, customers, employees, and branches using SQL. It features relational tables, sample data, and queries for efficient library operations and data management.

Library Management System Project Overview:
 This project is a comprehensive Library Management System designed to streamline the management of library operations, including tracking books, customers, employees, and branch details. The system is implemented using SQL to create a structured relational database, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis.

Features
 Branch Management: Maintain details of library branches, including branch numbers, addresses, contact information, and managers.
 Employee Records: Track employee details such as their roles, salaries, and branch assignments.
 Book Inventory: Manage book details, including ISBNs, titles, categories, rental prices, availability status, authors, and publishers.
 Customer Database: Store customer information with unique IDs, addresses, and registration dates.
 Issue and Return Tracking: Record details of book issues and returns, linking books and customers effectively.
Database Structure:
The database includes six tables:
 Branch
 Employee
 Books
 Customer
 IssueStatus
 ReturnStatus
Each table is carefully structured with primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to ensure data integrity.

The project includes a variety of SQL queries to perform essential tasks:
 Retrieving book availability.
 Listing employees by salary.
 Linking issued books to customers.
 Summarizing book counts by category.
 Filtering data based on conditions like dates or counts.
 
This project is a great starting point for learning and applying relational database concepts in real-world scenarios.
